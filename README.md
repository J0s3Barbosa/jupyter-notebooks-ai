## Features
- Jupyter Notebooks for AI model testing
- LangChain for building AI-powered applications
- Ollama for efficient model execution
- LM Studio for managing and testing local AI models
- Local AI deployment and experimentation

## Requirements
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- LangChain
- Ollama
- LM Studio
